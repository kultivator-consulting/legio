An aerial search led them to the Alexander farm, a stunning 1,250 acre sheep farm in the heart of the Waikato. They noted the area&rsquo;s striking similarity to The Shire&trade;, as described by JRR Tolkien, and quickly realised that the Hobbits&trade; had found a home.<br /><br />In one particular part of the farm, a magnificent pine tree towered over a nearby lake, adjacent to a rising hill. Bag End now sits atop that hill, overlooking the Party Tree, as that pine would later be known. The surrounding areas were untouched; no power lines, no buildings and no roads in sight. This meant that Sir Peter Jackson could leave the 20th century behind, and fully submerge himself in the fantasy world of Middle-earth&trade;.<br /><br />In March 1999 the crew began the nine month quest to bring the ideas for Hobbiton to fruition; help was provided by the New Zealand Army, and soon 39 temporary Hobbit Holes&trade; were scattered across the 12 acre plot used for the set. Secrecy was key, and strict security measures were put in place by the production company throughout construction and filming. Filming commenced in December 1999, and it took around three months to get a wrap on The Shire.<br /><br />After an initial attempt at demolition, 17 bare plywood facades remained. These shells would serve as the catalyst that propelled Hobbiton forward into the public eye, with guided tours commencing in 2002.<br /><br />In 2009, Sir Peter Jackson returned to film The Hobbit trilogy, and he left behind the beautiful movie set you&rsquo;ll see today; 44 permanently reconstructed Hobbit Holes, in the same fantastic detail seen in the movies. In 2012 The Green Dragon&trade; Inn was opened as the finale to the journey. Guests now finish their Hobbiton Movie Set experience with a refreshing beverage from the Hobbit&trade; Southfarthing&trade; Range. There&rsquo;s an abundance of movie magic nestled inside the fully operational farm.</p>""|""|0|""iris_operators_1479339912.jpg""|""https://www.intercity.co.nz/""|""Pacific/Auckland""|""en""|""|""(09) 583 5780""|0|1

While there is no long term parking on-site, there are plenty of parking options nearby. On board, there is heaps of stuff to help make your journey awesome.</p>\n<p><strong>Walking on</strong><br />Foot passengers should check in at the terminal at least 1 hour before your sailing time. Remember to ensure any luggage is properly labelled and packed securely. In Wellington our team will guide you from the terminal building to our ship on-foot. We can arrange a transfer with our passenger van if you would prefer a little assistance.&nbsp; We also like to use our passenger van when the weather isn't too flash to keep you all as comfortable as possible. In Picton foot passengers are transported via shuttle bus from the terminal building to the ship (short journey). &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Cyclists</strong><br />Cyclists should check in at the terminal at least 1 hour before your sailing time. In Wellington our team will guide you from the terminal building to our ship. In Picton cyclists are asked to follow the passenger shuttle bus from the terminal to the ship. PLEASE <strong>NOTE:</strong> You are permitted to ride to the stern ramp but you must walk across the ramp and there is no riding allowed inside the ship itself. <br /><br />Your bicycle will be stored beneath the decks inside and out of the weather. We supply lashings to secure bicycles to ship rails/brackets and rags for padding but we do encourage owners to bring their own.&nbsp; A member of our staff will be on hand to provide you with assistance or advice if required.</p>\n<p><strong>Driving on</strong><br />Luckily, getting your vehicle onto our ferry is easier than it looks, and minimal preparation is required to make sure you have a safe and easy journey. Our awesome crew are also there to help you every step of the way so please don&rsquo;t be afraid to ask for assistance.<br /><br />If you&rsquo;re travelling in a vehicle, you need to be at the terminal at least an hour before departure and should check in at the vehicle booth &ndash; not inside the terminal. As you won&rsquo;t have access to your vehicle during sailing, make sure you have everything you need for your trip in your hand luggage. You&rsquo;ll be expected to drive your vehicle safely onboard, although our crew are there to help if you need it. When boarding at night, remember to turn your lights off before you approach the ship's ramp so as not to blind our crew. Double-check your handbrake is on, put it in gear, turn-off your alarm and lock your vehicle.</p>\n<p>Childrens age is 1 - 17 Years Inclusive.</p>""|""|0|""iris_operators_1455755729.jpg""|""http://www.bluebridge.co.nz""|""|""|""|""|0|1
